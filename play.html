<h6>THE LAST STRAW_Bosworth Crocker_ </h6>
<p>MRS. BAUER. [_Absently._] Was she an old maid?

    LANE. The cruelty-to-animals woman over there [_waves his
    hand_]--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.
    
    MRS. BAUER. I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
    one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.
    
    LANE. Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
    dog.
    
    MRS. BAUER. He don't do nothin' of the sort--jus' drives it 'way from
    the garbage-pails--that's all. We coulda had that dog took up long
    ago--they ain't got no license. But Fritz--he's so easy--he jus' takes
    it out chasin' the dog and hollerin'.
    
    LANE. That ain't no way. He ought to make the dog holler--good and
    hard--once; then it'd keep out of here.
    
    MRS. BAUER. Don't you go to talkin' like that 'round my man. Look at all
    this trouble we're in on account of a stray cat.</p>
