<h6>THE LAST STRAW_Bosworth Crocker_ </h6>
<p>MRS. BAUER. (_Absently._) Was she an old maid?</p>

   <h6> LANE</h6>
   <p>The cruelty-to-animals woman over there (_waves his
    hand_)--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right</p>
    
   <h6>MRS.BAUER</h6> 
   <P> I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
    one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it</p>
    
    <h6>LANE</h6>
    <p>Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
    dog</p>
    
   <h6> MRS. BAUER</h6>
   <p>He don't do nothin' of the sort--jus' drives it 'way from
    the garbage-pails--that's all. We coulda had that dog took up long
    ago--they ain't got no license. But Fritz--he's so easy--he jus' takes
    it out chasin' the dog and hollerin'</p>
    
    <h6>LANE</h6>
    <p> That ain't no way. He ought to make the dog holler--good and
    hard--once; then it'd keep out of here</p>
    
    <h6>MRS. BAUER</h6>
    <P>Don't you go to talkin' like that 'round my man. Look at all
    this trouble we're in on account of a stray cat</p>
